        <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
        <p>Hey Raph, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry for what happened. I can not lose you.
            I just can not 
            You are one person who accepted me for who I am and never did judge me.
            Like where exactly am I supposed to see someone who cared for me like you did? Or someone who understands me? Where biko?
            You have done things for me I can not hastily forget 
            It is not even possible. 
            I do not even want to say some things right now but Raphael I do not want you to leave. We do not always get what we want but mehn not this time.
            You are literally my best friend. Just you. I do not have a lot. So I can not just let the one I have leave me alone. 
            Raphael I have fucked up enough I have messed up too much, way too much that I can not believe I did that but I am willing to make a difference. I figured my problem and who knows if this is how I have been to other people and they did not say nothing to me. I am willing to be better üò™
            I do not want to cause you any hurt anymore. I hate it that I do that 
            The crazy part is it is unintentional but it will not happen again.
            For the last incident I am so so sorry 
            That was the dumbest thing someone could ever do. I messed up and I am sorry 
            Find a place in your heart to forgive me.
            I do not want us to end.
            I am so so sorry üôèüèΩ
            </p>
        <p>Do you forgive me?</p>
